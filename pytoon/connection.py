        My electricity meter uses light flashes to indicate that one Wh is delivered by the utility company. These
        flashes are not easily countable. There are several problems:
        1. The flash is short in duration but not infinitely short,
           If the emitted light flash were infinitely short in duration, then we could determine exactly at which moment
           it occurs and when the next one occurs. Unfortunately, the shape of the flash is as follows. The luminance
           rises very rapidly and then dies down rapidly. So, the flash takes some time (approximately 100 milliseconds)
           to occur. If we naively set a callback for every value other than 0, we would get several measurements for
           one flash.
        2. Flashes are measured having different intensities,
           I'm not sure why this happens, but the bricklet sometimes reports different values for each flash. We cannot
           assume that each flash results in roughly the same intensity.
        3. The time interval between flashes may vary, realistically, between 1 second and 30 seconds or even more.
           These intervals are highly variable, which means that we cannot just take measurements at certain intervals.
        4. Someone may open the closet where the electricity meter is located, inadvertently increasing the light
           intensity. This is still an unsolved problem.

        The solution is to set the debounce period to approximately 400 milliseconds, long enough for the light
        intensity to return to zero after a flash, but short enough to be ready for the next light flash.
